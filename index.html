            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
          </p>

          <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
          
          <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>

          <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        </article>

            An element is a part of a webpage an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag.
          </p>
          <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="Parts of an HTML Element"/>
          <ol>
            <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
            <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
            <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
            <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
          </ol>
          <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="attributes">
          <p>
            Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.
          </p>
          <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
          </ol>

        <header>Nesting Elements</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a strong element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Void_Elements">
        <header>Void Elements</header><article>
          <p>
         Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the img element that we already have in our HTML page:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;img src=&quot;images/firefox-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;My test image&quot; /&gt;</code>
        <p>
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;img&gt; tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_Document">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML Document</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The following parts of the HTML Document above are the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
            <li>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
            <li>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
            <li>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;— This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
            <li>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;— This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
            <li>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt;element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
            <li>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Images">
        <header>Images</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The image element embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
          </p>
          <code>&lt;img src=&quot;images/firefox-icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;My test image&quot; /&gt;</code>
          <p>
            We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
            <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. Which will result it to showing the value of the alt attribute, in this case the value <i>My test image</i></li>
          </ol>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Headings">
        <header>Headings</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt;!-- 4 heading levels: --&gt;
                  &lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;
          </code></pre>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Paragraphs">
        <header>Paragraphs</header>
        <article>
          <p>
             &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
        <header>Lists</header>
        <article>
          <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; element.</li>
            <li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt; element.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an &lt;li&gt; (list item) element.</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we're a global community of&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;

            Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
            <li>Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt; element, as shown below:
            <code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </li>

            <li>Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute, as shown below:
            <code>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </li>
            <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:
            <code>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
